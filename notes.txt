Daphne:-------------------------------
Daphne is an ASGI server (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) developed as part of Django Channels. Think of it as the async replacement for WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI, but built for handling both HTTP and WebSockets.
Why do you need Daphne?
When you use Django with Channels (for WebSockets, long polling, real-time updates), the regular WSGI servers won’t work because they don’t support WebSocket or async protocols.

That’s where Daphne comes in — it can:
- Serve regular HTTP requests (like normal Django)
- Handle WebSocket connections (for real-time chat, notifications, etc.)
- Handle long-lived connections (like for IoT or multiplayer apps)

--------------------------------------------

Django Channels Overview-------------------------------------
Django Channels enables Django to handle asynchronous protocols alongside regular HTTP.

It introduces a concept of Consumers, which are like Django views but for WebSockets or other asynchronous protocols.

Channels use an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) application instead of WSGI (used for regular HTTP requests), making it suitable for handling asynchronous communication.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Channels introduces three key pieces:

(1) ASGI application – replaces WSGI; lets Django handle HTTP and WebSockets.

(2) Consumer – the “view” for WebSockets; runs async, keeps the connection open.

(3) Channel Layer – a Redis‑ or IPC‑backed pub/sub system used to broadcast between consumers (e.g., all clients in a chat room).


- In computer science, handshaking is a process that ensures the server is in sync with its clients (e.g., desktop, smartphone, tablet). Handshaking is the basic concept of Web Socket protocol.
- Web Sockets Definition
	- Web sockets are defined as a two-way communication between the servers and the clients, which mean both the parties communicate and exchange data at the same time.
- HTTP has its own set of schemas such as http and https. Web socket protocol also has similar schema defined in its URL pattern.
	- ws://example.com:8000/chat.php ------> schema://host:port/server 

- The steps for establishing the connection of Web Socket are as follows −

	- The client establishes a connection through a process known as Web Socket handshake.

	- The process begins with the client sending a regular HTTP request to the server.

	- An Upgrade header is requested. In this request, it informs the server that request is for Web Socket connection.

	- Web Socket URLs use the ws scheme. They are also used for secure Web Socket connections, which are the equivalent to HTTPs.

- It is necessary to initialize the connection to the server from client for communication between them. For initializing the connection, creation of Javascript object with the URL with the remote or local server is required.

	- var socket = new WebSocket( ws://echo.websocket.org );

- There are four main Web Socket API events −
(1) Open: Once the connection has been established between the client and the server, the open event is fired from Web Socket instance. It is called as the initial handshake between client and server. The event, which is raised once the connection is established, is called onopen.
(2) Message: Message event happens usually when the server sends some data. Messages sent by the server to the client can include plain text messages, binary data or images. Whenever the data is sent, the onmessage function is fired.
(3) Close: Close event marks the end of the communication between server and the client. Closing the connection is possible with the help of onclose event. After marking the end of communication with the help of onclose event, no messages can be further transferred between the server and the client. Closing the event can happen due to poor connectivity as well.
(4) Error: Error marks for some mistake, which happens during the communication. It is marked with the help of onerror event. Onerror is always followed by termination of connection. 

- Web Sockets Actions
Events are usually triggered when something happens. On the other hand, actions are taken when a user wants something to happen. Actions are made by explicit calls using functions by users.

The Web Socket protocol supports two main actions, namely −

(1) send( ): This action is usually preferred for some communication with the server, which includes sending messages, which includes text files, binary data or images.
	- Note − Sending the messages is only possible if the connection is open.
(2) close( ): This method stands for goodbye handshake. It terminates the connection completely and no data can be transferred until the connection is re-established.


---------------------------------------how websocket initiates?------------------------
- In WebSocket communication, the client always initiates the connection — not the server.
- Here's why:
	-The WebSocket protocol is designed this way. The client (usually a browser or mobile app) sends a WebSocket handshake request to the server using HTTP (called the Upgrade request).
	- The server responds to this request and upgrades the connection to a persistent WebSocket connection.
	- After the connection is established, both client and server can send messages at any time.

- Why can't the server initiate a WebSocket connection?
	- Servers typically don’t have direct access to the client’s network or browser due to:
	- Firewalls/NAT
	- Browser sandboxing/security
	- No persistent way to know when a client is available to accept a connection

---------------------------------------JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() in JS:-------------------------------------------------

JSON.parse(): in javascript
- This function takes a JSON-formatted string and converts it into a JavaScript object.
- example:
	- const jsonString = '{"user": "Alice", "text": "Hi"}';
	  const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
	  console.log(obj.user); // Alice
	  console.log(obj.text); // Hi

JSON.stringify(): in javascript
- it is the opposite of JSON.parse().
- It converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string.
- example:
	- const obj = { user: "Alice", text: "Hi" };
	  const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
	  console.log(jsonString); // {"user":"Alice","text":"Hi"} in the form of string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Each WebSocket connection is a separate and persistent connection between a specific user (or browser tab) and the server.
- Each connection is handled by a separate consumer instance (your AsyncWebsocketConsumer class), and Django Channels can manage all of these connections in parallel, using Redis to help with group communication.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- channel layer:
	- enables communication between consumers
	- working of django channel layer:
	Client A  --> WebSocketConsumer (User A)     -->   join group 'chat_room_1'
	Client B  --> WebSocketConsumer (User B)     -->   join group 'chat_room_1'

	Now, if User A sends a message:
	WebSocketConsumer (User A)  --> channel_layer.group_send('chat_room_1', {...})
								|
								v
		Django Channels dispatches to all consumers in 'chat_room_1'
								|
								v
			WebSocketConsumer (User B) receives the message

------------------------------------------------------
steps for chatting:
- websocket connection requested by the client (chatSocket = new WebSocket('ws://' + window.location.host + '/ws/support/' + roomName + '/');)
- The request goes to /ws/support/support_42/
- Django Channels Connects Consumer using connect() method
	- Django Channels extracts room_name from URL.
	- room_group_name = support_support_42
	- The WebSocket is added to a Channels group: All clients (user and support agent) in this room receive messages from this group.
	- Connection is accepted.
- User Sends a Message:
	- JS sends the message over the WebSocket.
	chatSocket.send(JSON.stringify({
			'message': inputField.value
		}));
- Consumer Receives Message:
	- receive() method is called automatically by Django Channels.
	- Message is sent to the room group using group_send.
	- This triggers the chat_message method on all consumers in the room group.
- Message Broadcast to All Clients: 
	- chat_message() runs in all consumers listening on that group.
	- The message is sent to each connected WebSocket client using self.send().
- Client JS Receives the Message: 
	- Browser JS receives the WebSocket message.
	- Message is shown in the chat window and saved to DB via /save_message/ endpoint.
- Support Agent Responds:
	- On the support team’s UI, the same WebSocket room (support_42) is opened.
	- When the support agent types and sends a message, the flow is exactly the same:
		- WebSocket send() → receive() in consumer → group_send() → chat_message() → message broadcast to all clients → both user and support see it.

------Summary: Key Function Flow
Event							Code Path
WebSocket connection			chat.js → new WebSocket() → asgi.py → project/routing.py → app/routing.py → SupportChatConsumer.connect()
User sends message				chat.js → chatSocket.send()
Consumer receives				SupportChatConsumer.receive()
Broadcast message				channel_layer.group_send()
Consumers in room receive		SupportChatConsumer.chat_message()
Message sent to frontend		chatSocket.onmessage() (in JS)
Support responds				Same flow in reverse (from support UI JS → backend → user UI)
